My name is Will Bodeau, and I will begin my PhD studies in statistics in Fall 2026, with a focus on spatial statistics and its applications in environmental and biological sciences.

I received my B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from UCLA, where I conducted research in environmental microbiology, computational biology, and Earth science. Through this work, I became interested in how statistical methodology can unify problems that may arise across domains. For example, spatial methods originally developed to tackle problems in climate science can be adapted to biomedical data, preserving spatial structure and context where it is often overlooked. 

Please feel free to contact me regarding research or collaboration.
